### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is a project that that is aimed that ascertaining if there is ascertaining if there is any form of gender inequality in the operations of the company with the view to balance the gender distribution if at all there is any. By meticulous analysis of the data, the company will be able to make informed decision that will enable them to confidently challenge any criticism that is confirmed to be baseless.

### ANALYSIS TOOL

I was requested to use Power bi to execute this project and that is what I used.

### REQUIREMENTS

CASE SCENARIO 

●  Analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address. 

● The analysis should be visualised using appropriate charts. 

● The focus should be on gender-related issues within the organization and its regions.

● The insights required are based on your discretion. However, Mr Gamma, as an insider, has offered to give you pointers on areas you need to pay attention to.

### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURES 

- I painstakingly read all that concerns the project and the given parameters as well as the data supplied to me by company. This enable me to understand what steps I am to take towards achieving the goal.
  
- Import the both files given to me and transformed the two tables using power query.
  
- In the course of transforming my data, I removed unwanted columns (While on power query, right click on the column you intend to remove and click remove). I promoted my column header by making first row header (Click on anywhere in the table, click transform tab, on the table fields click on use first row as header).
